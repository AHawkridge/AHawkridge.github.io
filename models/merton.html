        One of the first models to capture the the volatility smile was the Merton Jump Diffusion model (MJD), it was first
        introduced by R. Merton in the aim to extend the Black-Scholes model to remove some of its assumptions. The
        model states that the underlying assets have occasional large discontinuous jumps in price while still following the
        normal GBM. These large jumps are infrequently observed in the market, but would not be possible to model with just
        GBM, Merton’s model integrates these jumps into the price dynamics of the underlying asset, providing a more complete
        description of the underlying assets behavior. The following stochastic differential equation is proposed to describe these
        asset price jumps:

        \[ S_t = S_0 e^{(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} - \lambda k)t + \sigma W_t +\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} J_i} \]

        The additional summation is the compound Poisson process, it is the result of all the jumps that occur over the stock
        path. The additional λk term comes from the Poisson distribution and ensures that the drift rate is not effected by the
        inclusion of jumps .
