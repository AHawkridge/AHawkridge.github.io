        One of the first models to capture the the volatility smile was the Merton Jump Diffusion model (MJD), it was first
        introduced by R. Merton in the aim to extend the Black-Scholes model to remove some of its assumptions. The
        model states that the underlying assets have occasional large discontinuous jumps in price while still following the
        normal GBM. These large jumps are infrequently observed in the market, but would not be possible to model with just
        GBM, Merton’s model integrates these jumps into the price dynamics of the underlying asset, providing a more complete
        description of the underlying assets behavior. The following stochastic differential equation is proposed to describe these
        asset price jumps:

        \[ S_t = S_0 e^{(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} - \lambda k)t + \sigma W_t +\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} J_i} \]

        The additional summation is the compound Poisson process, it is the result of all the jumps that occur over the stock
        path. The additional λk term comes from the Poisson distribution and ensures that the drift rate is not effected by the
        inclusion of jumps.

    <h2>Implied Volatility</h2>
    <p>
        One of the defeciencies of the Black-Scholes model is that it assumes a constant volatility from geometric brownian motion, this mean it cannot capture real
        financial markets as a parabolic shape is often observed known as the volatility smile. Through the implementation of the compound poisson process the volatility
        is no longer a constant as the jumps act as moments of high volatility in the stock, therefore a smile is achievable as seen in plot below:

    <p>
        This model is unique in that the volatilty of the Geometric brownian motion still remains constant however its effective volatility is variable.

    <h2>Distribution of Log-Returns</h2>
    <p>
        The MJD model behaves identically to the Black-Scholes model if no jump occurs in the given time. If a jump does
        occur, it will still follow the same GBM after the discontinuous jump and as such, the distribution is expected to follow a
        similar pattern the that of the Black-Scholes model except with the exception of larger tails due to the jumps increasing
        the likelihood of extreme stock values. Furthermore, if there is equal probability that the jump will cause the stock price
        to increase or decrease, that is m = 0, the distribution will exhibit no skew, however to generate the volatility smile for
        this model there is a higher probability that the stock price will jump upwards, m = 0.3, yielding a positive skew when
        compared to the normal distribution. 

        To generate this distribution the Poisson distribution from the jumps and the normal distribution from the GBM have 
        to be combined as seen in the following:
\begin{equation}
    N \sim \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    Pois \sim \frac{ (\lambda T)^k e^{-\lambda T}}{k!}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    f_k(x) = \frac{(\lambda T)^k e^{-\lambda T}}{k!} \frac{1}{\sigma \sigma_J \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu T - \mu_J k}{\sigma})^2}
\end{equation}
where the subscripts \(J\) differentiates between the jump and GBM means and volatilites. The probability 
density function is then meant to be obtained through summing over all possible value for \(k\)
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}f_k(x),
\end{equation}
 
However in the calculations \(k\) is summed up to 20 to truncate the infinite sum, this is done to ease the computational intensity
 and yield a good approximation and will have little effect of the resulting probability distribution. It can be seen that the distribution
  deviates greatly from the normal distribution and has an increased mean and positive skew, this is to be expected as there a single jump on 
  average per stock path although the size of the jump can vary,and it is more likely to jump upwards, creating this increased mean and skew.
